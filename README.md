If you've just created a new TikTok account and need a quick boost, Iâ€™ve discovered the fastest way to gain your first followers. While this method isn't a long-term strategy for building an engaged community, it can give you the momentum you need in the beginning. I personally gained over 200 followers in less than 24 hours while spending under two hours on the app.

<strong>Step 1: Search for #FollowTrain</strong>

Start by searching for the hashtag #followtrain on TikTok. These videos attract small creators looking to grow, making them the perfect place to connect with others who share the same goal.

<strong>Step 2: Engage with #FollowTrain Videos</strong>

Once you find recent videos using this hashtag, follow the instructions in the captions. Typically, creators will ask you to:

âœ… Like the video

âœ… Comment on the post

âœ… Like other peopleâ€™s comments

âœ… Follow the creator and other participants

I personally follow the creator, like their video, leave a comment, and engage with others in the comment section. This increases visibility and encourages more people to follow you back.

<strong>Step 3: Watch the Follower Count Grow</strong>

As you engage, youâ€™ll notice followers rolling in almost immediately. I was able to gain 50 followers in just 30 minutes. To keep the momentum going, follow back those who support you. Keep in mind that TikTok has daily follow limits, so be strategic.

<strong>Step 4: Clean Up & Build Real Connections</strong>

Once youâ€™ve gained a good number of followers, revisit your following list and unfollow those who didnâ€™t follow back. More importantly, engage with your new followers by watching, liking, and commenting on their content. This builds micro-relationships that help you stay top of mind.

<strong>The Key to Long-Term Growth</strong>

While this method is great for a quick start, donâ€™t rely on it to reach 10,000 followers. You want genuine followers who engage with your content, not just a high number that looks good on paper. Once youâ€™ve gained an initial audience, shift your focus to creating niche content, following trends, and standing out with your unique style.
With patience, consistency, and the right strategy, your TikTok will grow into a true community of engaged fans.
